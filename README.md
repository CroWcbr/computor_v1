## What are solutions of such equations?
- if degree == 0
  - and c == 0, X can be any real number.
  - and c != 0, the wrong inequality.
- if degree == 1, X will always have one solution.
- if degree == 2
  - if discriminant = 0: equation have one real solution.
  - if discriminant > 0: equation have two real solutions.
  - if discriminant < 0: equation have two complex solutions.

## Bonus
- Manage entry mistakes (vocabulary and syntax)
- Manage free form entrie
- Display solution(s) as an irreducible fraction
- Display the intermediate steps
- complex solution
